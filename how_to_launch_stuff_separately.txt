Being inside of the robot you can execute (note that if you launch one of the standalone nodes 
a nodelet_manager will be launched, so next ones to be launched
should be the _nodelet.launch nodes):

To stop everything:

    botapp stop airos

To start the servos (no nodelet version):

    roslaunch airos4_servo servo_standalone.launch

To start the camera:

    roslaunch airos4_camera camera.launch
    roslaunch airos4_camera camera_nodelet.launch

To start tts to make robot talk:
    roslaunch airos4_tts tts.launch
    roslaunch airos4_tts tts_nodelet.launch

To start robot mouth screen:
    roslaunch airos4_mouth mouth.launch

To start robot heart:
    roslaunch airos4_heart heart.launch

To start touch node:
    roslaunch airos4_touch touch.launch

To start accelerometer node:
    roslaunch airos4_accel accel.launch

To start speech recognition (ASR):
    roslaunch airos4_asr asr_nodelet.launch
    roslaunch airos4_asr asr.launch

From your computer:

To play with the servos:

    rosrun aisoy_playground servos_dyn_rec.py

And get the GUI with:
    rosrun rqt_reconfigure rqt_reconfigure


To visualize the camera:
    rosrun rqt_image_view rqt_image_view

To activate asr:
    rosservice call /asr/set_grammar "data: 'hello|hi|bye'"

Listen with:
    rostopic echo /asr/recognition
